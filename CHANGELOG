#### [2.0] - 2020-04-22

PLEASE NOTE: Version 2.0 is a major refactor from [Chris R.'s project](https://github.com/cdrx/rancher-gitlab-deploy) 
and therefore will require some changes to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file(s).
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}

* 💥 Breaking changes! Not backward-compatible.
* 💄 Renamed package to "ranchlab"...cause it's shorter 😁
* ✅ Added some testing capabilities for developers 
* 🐛 Fixed handling of service links
* ✨ Enabled usage of more complex environment variables
* ✨ Enabled selection of API version (Currently only v1 and v2-beta are supported. ☸️ Kubernetes next?)

##### Disclaimer
I haven't taken the time to thoroughly re-test everything yet beyond creating and updating stacks and services and 
adding labels, variables and service links. Hopefully I haven't broken any of the core functionality!
